# Frequently Asked Questions
This will be updated as you ask questions on the Google+ community.

**Q: Are Introductory Sessions on Skype or Google?**<br>
**A:** From this point, all of our sessions will be conducted via Google Hangout. Please sign up for your introductory session on the [Phase 0 app](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com). 

**Q: How do I change my DBC email address?** <br>
**A:** You'll need to do two things to start the process for changing your email. Log into [Dev Bootcamp's Application Website](http://apply.devbootcamp.com/) and change your account email first. Then complete the "Email Address Change Request" form located on your task list.

This form will only be viewable once you officially start Phase 0. Please try to change your email at least one week prior to your Phase 0 start. Once you get a Socrates login, you will need to complete the email address change request form.

**Q: Can we visit or use DBC space in Phase 0?** <br>
**A:** In order to maintain an optimal learning environment for students in Phases 1 - 3, Phase 0 students are not permitted to study in DBC sites prior to starting phase 1. Phase 0 students may, however, sign up for a tour ([CHI](http://my.setmore.com/shortBookingPage/0df7e742-ac22-4daf-bb03-7d5519a01fe1), [NYC](http://my.setmore.com/shortBookingPage/64ca252f-bf57-4680-b027-c2ed82bcb493), [SF](http://my.setmore.com/shortBookingPage/df34b42d-2a7d-47d9-8a24-f8bfe36de9f0)) from 4-6pm on Tuesdays or attend DBCx meetups ( [CHI](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-DevBootcamp-Speaker-Series/), [NYC](http://www.meetup.com/DBCx-NYC/), [SF](http://www.meetup.com/DBCx-SF-Dev-Bootcamp-San-Francisco-Open-Learning/)) in the space during events.

**Q: What are the hours at DBC?** <br>
**A:** Building and Core hours vary by location.

Core hours are the hours of instruction where students are required to be on site and teachers will be present.

In **Chicago**, core hours are 8:00am - 5:00pm, and lunch is from 11:30am - 1:00pm.

In **New York City** and **San Francisco**, core hours are from 9:00am - 6:00pm, and lunch is from 12:30pm - 2:00pm.

Building hours for New York City and San Francisco are 7:00am - 2:00am. Students are not allowed to be in the building outside of these hours.

In Chicago, the building is open 24/7, but students are not allowed to stay the night.

**Q: Is DBC closed on US federal holidays?**<br>
**A:** DBC only honors the following holidays that occur during phases: Thanksgiving, Independence Day (July 4), and New Year's Day. During those days, the staff has the day off, but the curriculum is still up and needs to be completed. Phase 0 staff honor the following additional holidays: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, and the day after Thanksgiving. 

**Q: I'm thinking of getting a new laptop. What are your suggestions?**<br>
**A:** We have a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13JGWKAjjdx7-0kpLCmBQN2i5C5xhlgnVflj6CuQrvMk/edit?usp=sharing) written by a former student with some info on laptops. This is not super official DBC policy or anything, but hopefully it helps. 

**For many other questions**<br>
Make sure you read through the handbook thoroughly. Substitute "Phase 0 Handbook" for "Syllabus" in the following cartoon.
