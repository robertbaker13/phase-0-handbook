# How to Reflect

Reflecting is an incredibly important part of the learning process. It requires you to take a moment and think about what you've learned, what is confusing, and where you need to go. It documents your learning process. 

Reflections are mandatory for each challenge. Reflections should only take about **10-15 minutes** and be about a paragraph long.

When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. Your reflections aren't just for you and your teachers, they are for your fellow cohortmates as well.

Use these questions as a guideline. Choose the questions that will help you reflect on your process. You do not have to answer every question.

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?    
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
