# Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS)

## Purpose
Guided Pairing Sessions are designed to do three main things:

 1. Give students exposure to pairing in a supportive environment
 2. Help students develop greater technical understanding by giving them access to guides
 3. Prepare students for being on-site where there will be pairing every day

Guides use this time to see how students engage with one another, how they are progressing in terms of technical knowledge, and to help students develop a deeper understanding of technical material.

Each GPS challenge is designed to reinforce the learning competencies covered up to and including the previous week's challenges. These sessions are opportunities for you to identify and clarify concepts that were confusing, as well as to get practice pairing. Sometimes GPS curriculum will address new concepts. In these instances, you are expected to research in the session and practice your researching abilities.

## Expectations

Each student is required to attend six Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS) during Phase 0. Sessions are based on what week you are currently in and follow a specific curriculum. For this reason, they are only offered during the week they are assigned.

Sessions will be posted by noon the Friday before the week starts on the [Phase 0 App](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com). It is vital to sign up for these sessions early in order to complete the session in the week it is assigned. We only make one sessions for each student so you need to make it a priority to sign up early in order to find a session that works in your schedule. If you do not complete the GPS in the week it is assinged, we cannot guarentee you will be able to stay in the cohort you are currently in. Makeup sessions will only be given for emergencies.

If you are marked absent from a session you've signed up for, you will receive an email that states you are out of integrity with Dev Bootcamp. It then is up to you to reach out the the Phase 0 Team to get back in integrity.

The GPS schedule is as follows:

    Unit 1:
     - Week 1: Introductory Session
     - Week 2: GPS 1.1 Git workflow and Branching
     - Week 3: GPS 1.2 HTML + CSS

    Unit 2
     - Week 4: GPS 2.1 Refactoring, Selection, Iteration, Enumerables
     - Week 5: GPS 2.2 Classes, Methods, Objects
     - Week 6: GPS 2.3 Classes, Methods, Composite Objects

    Unit 3
     - Week 7: GPS 3.1 JavaScript

### Tips and Reminders

* Please connect to a reliable internet network in a quiet place.
* Wear headphones during GPS to reduce feedback.
* Cancel any sessions you cannot make **more than 6 hours prior to your session.**
* If you have an emergency come up at the last minute, email your guide, pair, and <phase0@devbootcamp.com> to let them know you will not be able to attend the session. Then cancel your slot in the Phase 0 app.
* If you need to reschedule, but all appointments are booked, please make an announcement to your cohort on your Google+ community page to ask someone to switch.

## Who are Guides?

A guide is a DBC alumni that now works part time for DBC to help the Phase 0 students. They have also been interviewed by a full time staff member to ensure they have the skills and qualities needed to be helpful to you as a student. They are a great resource for whatever questions you have regarding DBC. Each guide has completed Phase 0, the on-site protion of the program, and career week. Some of the guides already have a full time job and some are looking. This all means they have been in your shoes and can give you great advice and feedback about what is to come for you. They also have an extensive knowledge of the Phase 0 curriculum to be able to help you with any questions/concerns.

## The Guide's Role

Each guide has a slightly different style when conducting GPS sessions. Some are more active in guiding you through a challenge and some are more hands off. It is up to you to ask your guide to become more or less active in your sessions. Most guides will watch your session and let you work through the challenge with your pair and ask you to pause if they feel you are getting off track or about to go down a rabbit hole. Guides will also give you help with coding conventions, tips, style, and communication. They are also there to answer questions, help you ask good questions, and make sure you and your pair are on a similar page.

Although you have one hour with the guide, the challenges often take longer than an hour, which means you will likely need to set aside another time to finish the challenge with your pair. After the hour is up, the guide will leave you on your own to finish the challenge. You can finish at any time you and your pair are able to meet that week.

## Success Guidelines
These sessions are intended to help you become a better pair, have a stronger connection to DBC, and to feel more confident with the material. That said, they are also ways for us to track how you are doing in Phase 0 to this point and if you are keeping up with and understanding the material. Guided Pairing Sessions give us a better idea of whether you will be successful in the program. 

###Culturally we are looking for your:

	- Enthusiasm for programming and solving challenges
	- Willingness to check in, connect, and share how you are feeling
	- Curiosity of how things work
	- Showing your ignorance. If you don’t know something, speak up
	- Good balance of speaking and listening, driving and navigating
	- Engage the Phase 0 instructor when you and your pair is stuck

### Technically we are looking for you to:
	- Transfer knowledge from previous challenges to a new challenge
	- Identify concepts that are confusing and ask for help
	- Demonstrate your comfort with reading and writing code
	- Implement the technical skills you've learned

### You will be successful in GPS if you:
	- Express your opinions and ideas
	- Appoint a driver and navigator and swap roles with clear communication
	- Seek out and create space for your pair’s thoughts/opinions
	- Are considerate of your pair
	- Ask questions when you don’t understand something
	- Discuss various options with your pair as well as pros and cons
	- Demonstrate your ability to research methods, use IRB, etc.
	- Screenshare when appropriate to include your pair more fully
	- Let your pair know when you need thinking time instead of going silent
	- Experiment with the code and cultivate a spirit of play
	- Display familiarity with learning objectives
	- Use the knowledge you’ve gained to solve the challenge objectives
	- HAVE FUN!

### You will not be successful if you:
	- Let your pair take over completely and “coast” through the session
	- Act like you understand something when you don’t
	- Do not contribute to the code
	- Do not ask questions
	- Expect yourself to be perfect
	- Expect your pair to be perfect
	- Prioritize completion or speediness over understanding



##Feedback and Transparency

At the end of the session, the guide will give you verbal feedback on how they think the session went. The guide then will give you written feedback via email. This feedback will give you spefics on your code and how the session went. This feedback will also give you an idea if you are ahead, on track, behind, or struggling in in both cultural and technical competencies. This feedback is not meant to be a grade. It is meant to give you an better understanding of your current progress and wehre it can improve. This feedback will also give you a sense of progress over time on if you are improving or starting to struggle more.

*Please Note: If you receive a message that says you are behind or struggling, you must reach out to someone on the Phase 0 Team to discuss a plan to make sure you stay on track during Phase 0.

We are sharing feedback in this format for a couple of reasons:

1. We believe that information we collect pertaining to you and your progress should be transparent and easily available (to you)
2. We want you to know whether you are on the track for further success at Dev Bootcamp
3. We believe that you will be able to better tailor your preparation and progress in Phase 0 with this information

You are also required to leave feedback for your pair in the Feedbackinator. If you end up pairing with a guide, they will be be in the feedbackinator, so if you want to provide them with feedback you can email them.
