# Welcome to DBC!

We are so excited that you have decided to embark on this amazing, life changing journey with us.  Over the next few months you are not only going to learn how to "Build Beautiful and Meaningful Things" but you are going to learn a lot about yourself and otheres. There are a lot of staff at DBC you are going to interact with at different parts of the program. Each of these people are going to help guide you, support you, and challenge you all at the same time. Right now, you are about to start the remote part of DBC with the Phase 0 Team. 

This is the phase of DBC where you can, more or less, work at your own pace to start learning the fundamentals of software development and get introduced to the culture of DBC. You are going to work on getting your machine set up and learn the basics of the command line and GitHub in the first week. Then you will move into other topics like CSS, HTML, Ruby and JS.  We have designed Phase 0 to accomplish a few main goals:
* Get to know some of the people you are going to be on-site with. The main way this is going to get accomplished is within your accountability group, who you will check in with every week.
* Get your feet wet with pairing. When you come on-site you are going to be pairing about 95% of the time and we want you to start getting use to this from Day 1. In Phase 0 you are going to have required Peer Pairing sessions and Guided Pairing Sessions. After these sessions you will also give and receive feedback from your pair.
* Ensure that every student enters Phase 1 with a baseline experience to build on during Phases 1 - 3. Some students come to DBC with a little more experience than others and we want there to be a way to level that out some so eveyone has at least been exposted to the fundementals before starting Phase 1.
* Introduce you to DBC's style of "learning how to learn." While at DBC, you are going to be given challenges that will help you learn certain concepts. There are a lot of methods you are going to use to turely understand these concepts. There might be a lecture or video or there might be a specific book/document referenced in the challenge to guide you. But the main way you are going to learn the concepts is by working with your pair, using online docs, and googling when you get stuck. Along the way there will be a lot of people you can ask questions to. There are guides in Phase 0, instructors in Phases 1 - 3, and other alumni/mentors throughout the entire experience.
* Learning to expose your ignormace. This means knowing when you do not know something and being able to ask a quesion. There will be many people along your jouney at DBC that are willing and eager to help, you just have to ask for it. Whether it be a technical question, a concept you are not getting or simply needing someone to talk to and support you. 

Right now you are in your pre-Phase 0 prep period. Before you can start Phase 0, you will need to complete a few administrative tasks and personal preparation. Please go through each of these sections and complete each task. You should be well acquainted with our program and what is going to be expected of you once completeling these tasks and will be ready to start Phase 0 by your start date. If you do not feel fully acquanted or know exactly  what is expected of you, do not worry or freak out, there will be plenty of time to ask questions in your first week of Phase 0.

Here is a rough timeline of what you can expect from now until your start date:
* Right now you should be working on these prerequisites (please do not wait until your start date to do these)
* You will hear from us about a week before your start date. At this time we will help you get set up with the systems you will need to use in Phase 0 (Socrates, Phase 0 app, etc)
* The Friday before you start we will check in again to remind you to complete everything that is required (it is especially important that we have your GitHub user name by the Friday before your start date)
* During the first week of Phase 0 you will have an Intro Session with a member of the Phase 0 Team to make sure you have all your questions answered and are ready to hit the ground running

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or feedback for the Phase 0 Team, please contact us at <phase0@devbootcamp.com>. Please mention your start date in the email.

# Before Entering Phase 0

#### 0. Brief Introduction
Read our [Blog Post](http://devbootcamp.com/2014/05/08/why-phase-0-is-key-to-your-success-at-dev-bootcamp/) on Phase 0.
Phase 0 is an actual Phase of DBC; it is not optional. We cover the fundamentals you will need to be successful in the intensive on-site portion of DBC.

During your time in Phase 0, you can expect to spend about 15-25 hours a week on the requirements and challenges in our curriculum. While there is some flexibility in when you decide do these challenges during the week, this is still a very intense experience that needs to be given time and dedication. We do not encourage students to schedule any trips or vacations during this time. It adds an extra level of stress to completing your assigned work while trying to enjoy your trip or trying to play catch up when you return. There are weekly deadlines for challenges, pairing requirements, and other tasks you will be required to do each week. It is also not possible for you to work ahead with your Phase 0 curriculum.

We also do not suggest students quit their full time job before starting the program. There is a chance you may decide that becoming a programmer isn't for you only a few weeks in. If this is the case, you want to make sure you have other options open to you.


#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need each of these accounts prior to Phase 0, and we will ask you to provide links in your Socrates (our student application) profile when you receive your welcome email in the week prior to starting Phase 0.

- [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com)<br> We use Google Hangouts and Communities throughout Phase 0 so it is necessary that you have a Gmail account for these. We encourage students to use this Gmail account for all communication in Phase 0. If you signed up with a differnt email address and now want to change it to your Gmail address please go to [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) **before** starting Phase 0. **Make sure to activate Google+ on this account**

- [Github](https://github.com/)<br> You will start using github on the first day of Phase 0, so please create an account. This will be where you keep all of your code from Dev Bootcamp and becomes your technical resume when you apply for jobs - so you may want to select your username with that in mind.

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)<br>You will be using Twitter throughout Phase 0 and will have some challenges using the Twitter API later when you come on-site.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)<br> LinkedIn is an important resume tool and a part of your career search once you graduate DBC. Once you get to career week the Career Team will help edit and perfect this profile, but it helps if you have something to start from.

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)<br> You will get a Socrates account when you start Phase 0, and it will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face so we can get as much practice with your name as possible.

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)<br> Is where many techies make contributions or spend time looking for new, exciting things in the tech community. Creating an account allows you to post and reply.

#### 2. Personal Preparation

You are about to embark on a new learning experience. You will be challenged in new ways that will excite and frustrate you (often at the same time). It's important to prepare yourself for success by recognizing how you learn best and what you enjoy when you are in a learning environment. Recognizing what you need will help you be able to express what you need when learning and make your experience at Dev Bootcamp more fulfilling. You will be spending a significant amount of time working with others, so it's also vital to practice explaining your ideas to others. *Keep track of the your explanations and results below.*

You need to be able to:

- Explain the difference between <a href="http://examinedexistence.com/carol-dweck-on-fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">growth and fixed mindset</a>.
- Identify my
<a href="http://www.vark-learn.com/english/page.asp?p=questionnaire" target="_blank">VARK learning style</a>.
- Explain my <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="_blank">thinking style</a> and what I enjoy or find challenging when learning
- Identify strategies to work more effectively. Read [Nine Things Successful People Do Differently](https://hbr.org/2011/02/nine-things-successful-people/) for inspiration.

#### 3. Update your browser
It's very important that you're using the latest version of your web browser. For Phase 0, we recommend working with [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/).

#### 4. Typing and shortcuts
It's important to be able to type at a decent rate in this new career you've embarked on! That said, it's not the end of the world if you struggle with typing, just take some time to practice, practice, practice! And trust us, you will get pleanty of practice at DBC.

Take a baseline <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a> to see how fast you currently type.

Then practice. Try <a href = "http://www.typingtest.com/index.html" target="_blank">test</a>[typing.io](http://typing.io/) to practice typing code, which has a ton of strange symbols. Typing can be fun to practice and you can't get too good at it.

For shortcuts, try <a href = "https://www.shortcutfoo.com/" target="_blank">shortcutfoo.com</a>. You'll want to know about some of the awesome sublime text shortcuts.

#### 5. Computer setup
We provide computer setup instructions in Week 1 to help you get a developer environment up and running. That said, these instuctions are most beneficial on a computer that has a "clean" environment (i.e. one that hasn't been set up for development before), so please avoid trying to set up your computer in advance of Phase 0 if you haven't already. If you are working on a machine that has already been configured, you may have more issues with setup. 

If you are going to use a PC we highly recommend using either Unix or Linux rather than Windows.  You can look into [running Linux on Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/170870/5-ways-to-run-linux-software-on-windows/) prior to Phase 0. We provide Unix (Apple) computers on site, and Linux commands are more similar to Unix.

#### 6. Read the [Phase 0 Handbook](README.md)
This detailed document outlines the Phase 0 Program in great depth, so please take time to read it to get comfortable with Phase 0 and Dev Bootcamp!

#### 7. Watch
The following videos introduce some key concepts of the Phase 0 experience is based on. You will be expected to be familiar with each of these prior to starting Phase 0 as they are critical componemts of the culture we have at DBC.

- Engineering Empathy: [EQ: Emotional Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/99779530) 15 min
- Giving and Receiving [Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) 27 min
- Checking in before [Pairing](https://vimeo.com/76662569) 5 min

#### 8. Complete the End of Prep Survey
Navigate to [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) and complete the "End of Prep Survey" This is required to start Phase 0 and you will not have access to your weekly submission forms until this survey is completed.

#### 9. Additional Resources (Optional)
Take a look at a couple of these resources that look interesting to you.

##### Books
- <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Thinking-Learning-Refactor-Programmers/dp/1934356050" target="_blank">*Pragmatic Thinking and Learning*</a> by Andy Hunt. This book covers "how our brains are wired, and how to take advantage of your brain's architecture. You'll learn new trice and tips to learn more, faster, and retain more of what you learn."
- <a href = "http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do" target="_blank">*Apprenticeship Patterns*</a> by Dave Hoover. Are you doing all you can to further your career as a software developer? With today's rapidly changing and ever-expanding technologies, being successful requires more than technical expertise. To grow professionally, you also need soft skills and effective learning techniques. Honing those skills is what this book is all about. Authors Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye have cataloged dozens of behavior patterns to help you perfect essential aspects of your craft.
- <a href = "http://pragprog.com/book/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer" target="_blank">*The Passionate Programmer*</a> by Chad Fowler. This book is about creating a remarkable career in software development. In most cases, remarkable careers don’t come by chance. They require thought, intention, action, and a willingness to change course when you’ve made mistakes. Most of us have been stumbling around letting our careers take us where they may. It’s time to take control. This revised and updated second edition lays out a strategy for planning and creating a radically successful life in software development.
- <a href="http://www.barbaraoakley.com/books.html" target="_blank">*A Mind for Numbers*</a> by Barbara Oakley. In A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science—secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they’d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there’s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions—you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!
- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Intelligent-Touchstone/dp/0671212095" target="_blank">*How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading*</a> With half a million copies in print, How to Read a Book is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader, completely rewritten and updated with new material. Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them—from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading. Readers will learn when and how to “judge a book by its cover,” and also how to X-ray it, read critically, and extract the author’s message from the text. Also included is instruction in the different techniques that work best for reading particular genres, such as practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science works. Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests you can use measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension, and speed.
