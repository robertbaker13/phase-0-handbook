# Feedback

###Submitting Feedback

You must complete feedback using the [Feedbackinator](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) for every pairing session (GPS and Peer Pairing) you complete. Giving feedback is a mandatory aspect of Phase 0. Like many other things, this is an honor based system. We expect you are pairing the required number of times each unit and self reporting that number accurately in your weekly submission.

Please watch [Engineering Empathy on Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) prior to giving feedback for the first time for some guidelines on leaving good feedback. Writing good feedback is challenging and time consuming. But, it is important to make sure you are writing feedback that will help your pair grow as a partner and as a programmer.

### Meta Feedback

In order to make sure you and your pairs receive the feedback you've each submitted, all students are required to rate at least 20 pieces of feedback per unit. To rate feedback go to [Feedbackinator - Feedback Dashboard](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback). Socrates will not display your feedback (feedback from others to you) until you have four pieces that have been thoroughly rated, so it will take some before you get your first pieces of feedback from your pairs. Pairing early and often will help ensure you get feedback sooner.

**All feedback must be anonymous to protect privacy.**

It is mandatory you abstain from writing your pair's name or your own name anywhere in the free-form text. Since students review each piece of feedback and rate it for kindness, actionability, and specificity it should not be public who the feedback is coming from or going to. This is extremely important to make receiving feedback a safe and positive experience.

Please Note: Feedback is not editable, by you as a student or by the Phase 0 Team as admins, in Socrates once it's submitted.

Unfortunately, there is no counter in Socrates for you to keep track of the amount you rate, so it is up to you to keep track of how many pieces you've rated. You will be expected to keep track of how much feedback you rate and enter it on your weekly submission form.
